# ForestFireDetection - Team 28

As part of the Mobile Application Development course at Amrita School of Computing, we developed an AI-based solution for real-time forest fire detection. The project aimed to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to automatically detect and identify the occurrence of forest fires through image  analysis, enhancing early detection capabilities and minimizing response time.

We developed using deep learning models such as DenseNet achieved 92.5% accuracy, MobileNetV2 achieved 89.38%, and InceptionV3 achieved 87.5%. This project focuses on quick and efficient fire detection using image analysis.

The app was developed in Android Studio, where DenseNet was integrated to deliver reliable, real-time forest fire  predictions.
